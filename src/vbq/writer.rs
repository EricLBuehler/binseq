//! Writer implementation for VBINSEQ files
//!
//! This module provides functionality for writing sequence data to VBINSEQ files,
//! including support for compression, quality scores, and paired-end reads.
//!
//! The VBINSEQ writer implements a block-based approach where records are packed
//! into fixed-size blocks. Each block has a header containing metadata about the
//! records it contains. Blocks may be optionally compressed using zstd compression.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use binseq::vbq::{VBinseqWriterBuilder, VBinseqHeader};
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! // Create a VBINSEQ file writer
//! let file = File::create("example.vbq").unwrap();
//! let header = VBinseqHeader::with_capacity(128 * 1024, true, true, true);
//!
//! let mut writer = VBinseqWriterBuilder::default()
//!     .header(header)
//!     .build(file)
//!     .unwrap();
//!
//! // Write a nucleotide sequence
//! let sequence = b"ACGTACGTACGT";
//! writer.write_nucleotides(0, sequence).unwrap();
//!
//! // Writer will automatically flush when dropped
//! ```

/// - `w`: Word size (8 bytes)
/// - `Cs`: Chunk size of the primary sequence in 64-bit words
/// - `Cx`: Chunk size of the extended sequence in 64-bit words (for paired-end reads)
/// - `3`: Additional words for flag, primary length, and extended length
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `schunk` - Number of 64-bit words needed for the primary sequence
/// * `xchunk` - Number of 64-bit words needed for the extended sequence (0 for single-end)

/// Writer for VBINSEQ format files
///
/// The `VBinseqWriter` handles writing nucleotide sequence data to VBINSEQ files in a
/// block-based format. It manages the file structure, compression settings, and ensures
/// data is properly encoded and organized.
///
/// ## File Structure
///
/// A VBINSEQ file consists of:
/// 1. A file header that defines parameters like block size and compression settings
/// 2. A series of blocks, each with:
///    - A block header with metadata (e.g., record count)
///    - A collection of encoded records
///
/// Each block is filled with records until either the block is full or no more complete
/// records can fit. The writer automatically handles block boundaries and creates new
/// blocks as needed.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// The writer supports multiple formats:
/// - Single-end sequences with or without quality scores
/// - Paired-end sequences with or without quality scores
///
/// It's recommended to use the `VBinseqWriterBuilder` to create and configure a writer
/// instance with the appropriate settings.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use binseq::vbq::{VBinseqWriterBuilder, VBinseqHeader};
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// // Create a writer for single-end reads
/// let file = File::create("example.vbq").unwrap();
/// let mut writer = VBinseqWriterBuilder::default()
///     .header(VBinseqHeader::default())
///     .build(file)
///     .unwrap();
///
/// // Write a sequence
/// let flag = 0; // No special flags
/// let sequence = b"ACGTACGTACGT";
/// writer.write_nucleotides(flag, sequence).unwrap();
///
/// // Writer automatically flushes when dropped

    /// # Parameters

    /// * `x_qual` - The quality scores corresponding to each base in the extended sequence
    ///
    /// # Returns

    /// * `Ok(true)` - If the sequences and quality scores were successfully encoded and written
